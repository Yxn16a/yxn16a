## 👋  Hi, I’m Yves Ngenzi

### I program in Java using Spring Boot, JavaScript using Node.js, React.js / Next.js, and React Native. I am deeply passionate about both back-end and front-end application development, with a strong focus on building scalable, maintainable, and user-centric systems. I also work with Python, leveraging TensorFlow and scikit-learn to design, train, and test machine-learning models. I am highly motivated by continuous learning and make a deliberate effort to expand my skills every day. I regularly share what I am learning here, contribute to Sequelize (a JavaScript ORM), and plan to contribute to additional open-source projects as time allows.
